0. Linear Search

This program contains a function linear_search which searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm.

Prototype: int linear_search(int *array, size_t size, int value);
array: Pointer to the first element of the array to search in.
size: Number of elements in the array.
value: Value to search for.
Returns: The first index where the value is located, or -1 if not found or if the array is NULL.
Prints the value checked every time a comparison is made.
1. Binary Search

This program contains a function binary_search which searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary search algorithm.

Prototype: int binary_search(int *array, size_t size, int value);
array: Pointer to the first element of the array to search in.
size: Number of elements in the array.
value: Value to search for.
Returns: The index where the value is located, or -1 if not found or if the array is NULL.
Prints the array being searched every time it changes.
